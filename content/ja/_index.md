      title: What is YWAM Sendai?
      text: |
        YWAM is a global movement, united by shared [values](https://docs.ywamsendai.org/docs/about/values), driven by a passion to know God and make Him known. We have been making waves here in Japan since 1975, and Tohoku (north-east Japan) since 2018!
        
        Tohoku is a large and beautiful region that's known for its delicious fruit. Yet this region is home to few Christians. There are many towns and villages here with no church or missionary presence. We desire for this region to bare much spiritual fruit! Here, Jesus’ words definitely ring true. The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. (Matthew 9:37) We desire to be a "mission hub" for the whole region, pioneering new ministries in all 6 prefectures of Tohoku.
        
        Here at YWAM Sendai, we also believe that in order to see a true revival of Christianity in Japan, we need to communicate the Gospel in a way the Japanese understand. We want to explore creative ways in which we can express Christian worship in authentically Japanese ways: whether in music, art, writing, symbolism, nature, or prayer.

        - name: Evangelism
          description: We believe everyone has the right to hear the good news about Jesus and our prayer is to see fellowships of believers worshipping and following Jesus in every nation, tribe and tongue.<br /><br />Over 99% of the people in Tohoku do not know Jesus. We seek the creativity of the Holy Spirit in order to share the gospel – especially by simply sharing our lives with people.

        - name: Training
          description: YWAM's introductory course, the Discipleship Training School (YWAM DTS), is offered in many nations and languages. It’s an intensive six months of growing more like Jesus and serving Him in the world.<br /><br />We desire to train and equip the Japanese to reach their own people and to go into all the nations! We would love to have a bilingual DTS ran in Sendai, as well as other training and equipping programmes.

        - name: Mercy
          description: YWAM’s mercy ministry teams follow Jesus’ example of compassion to those in need. We operate relief and development programs in over 100 countries, working among people living in desperate circumstances.<br /><br />Although Japan is a wealthy nation, there are many areas of need in society such as depression, loneliness, suicide and homelessness. We want to play a part in bringing hope and joy to the Japanese!

        After the Discipleship Training School, journey alongside a community of people who desperately want to serve Jesus in North-East Japan with their whole lives.
        
        Invest in learning the Japanese culture and language, desiring to demonstrate the Gospel to the unreached millions you will encounter every day. Become like a Japanese, to win the Japanese (1 Cor. 9:20).

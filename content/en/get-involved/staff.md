Whatever way you want to serve God, you can most likely do it in YWAM! Being on staff with YWAM is an adventure in faith. Join staff for a couple of years, or stay for life.

In Sendai, one of the joys of joining staff is to serve side by side with people from a variety of nations and Christian backgrounds. As well as this, you will be immersed in the unreached region of Tohoku (North-East Japan), with its rich traditional Japanese culture and history, and scenic, peaceful nature.

All YWAMers in Sendai will be expected to invest in learning the Japanese culture and language, desiring to demonstrate the Gospel to the unreached millions you will encounter every day. Become like a Japanese, to win the Japanese (1 Cor. 9.20).

Here are a few of the ways you can serve as staff in Sendai:

* Accountants
* Graphic Designers
* Evangelists
* Administrators
* Church Planters
* Teachers
* Cooks
* Journalists/Editors
* Musicians
* Artists
* Gardeners
* Farmers
* Video Gamers
* Web Designers

## Salary and Benefits

YWAM does not pay its staff. Most of our staff meet their financial needs by partnering with friends and churches who support their ministry.

## How to Apply

To join YWAM Sendai staff you first need to complete a Discipleship Training School (DTS). DTS is the prerequisite to all our other training and opportunities and is offered at over 600 locations around the world.

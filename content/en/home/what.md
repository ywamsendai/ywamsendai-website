YWAM is a global movement, united by shared [values]({{< ref "https://docs.ywamsendai.org/docs/about/values" >}}), driven by a passion to know God and make Him known. We have been making waves here in Japan since 1975, and Tohoku (north-east Japan) since 2018!

Tohoku is a large and beautiful region that's known for its delicious fruit. Yet this region is home to few Christians. There are many towns and villages here with no church or missionary presence. We desire for this region to bare much spiritual fruit! Here, Jesusâ€™ words definitely ring true. The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. (Matthew 9:37) We desire to be a "mission hub" for the whole region, pioneering new ministries in all 6 prefectures of Tohoku.

Here at YWAM Sendai, we also believe that in order to see a true revival of Christianity in Japan, we need to communicate the Gospel in a way the Japanese understand. We want to explore creative ways in which we can express Christian worship in authentically Japanese ways: whether in music, art, writing, symbolism, nature, or prayer.

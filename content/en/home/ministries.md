    description: We believe everyone has the right to hear the good news about Jesus and our prayer is to see fellowships of believers worshipping and following Jesus in every nation, tribe and tongue.<br /><br />Over 99% of the people in Tohoku do not know Jesus. We seek the creativity of the Holy Spirit in order to share the gospel – especially by simply sharing our lives with people.

    name: Training
    description: YWAM's introductory course, the Discipleship Training School (YWAM DTS), is offered in many nations and languages. It’s an intensive six months of growing more like Jesus and serving Him in the world.<br /><br />We desire to train and equip the Japanese to reach their own people and to go into all the nations! We would love to have a bilingual DTS ran in Sendai, as well as other training and equipping programmes.

    name: Mercy
    description: YWAM’s mercy ministry teams follow Jesus’ example of compassion to those in need. We operate relief and development programs in over 100 countries, working among people living in desperate circumstances.<br /><br />Although Japan is a wealthy nation, there are many areas of need in society such as depression, loneliness, suicide and homelessness. We want to play a part in bringing hope and joy to the Japanese!
